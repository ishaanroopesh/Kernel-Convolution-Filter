Image Filtering using the mathematical concept of Convolution Matrices

-> Picture class from stdlib.jar is used to access the image file as a collection of pixels

-> Mathematical based custom convolution matrices of 3x3 form are used

-> These matrices hold values for the surrounding pixels, stating an floating-point value to each

-> The Kernel class then updates the rgb values of each pixel, based off the values held by the convolution matrix

-> A new picture stores the values of the new pixels to form the final image
