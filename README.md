Image Filtering using the mathematical concept of Convolution Matrices

-> Picture class from stdlib.jar is used to access the image file as a collection of pixels\n
-> Mathematical based custom convolution matrices of 3x3 form are used\n
-> These matrices hold values for the surrounding pixels, stating an integer value to each\n
-> The Kernel class then updates the rgb values of each pixel, based off the values held by the convolution matrix\n
-> A new picture stores the values of the new pixels to form the final image
